    <p>The CPI(M) is committed to establishing a socialist society free from exploitation, oppression, and inequality. It stands for the unity of the working class, peasants, and progressive forces to build a democratic and secular India.</p><br>

    <h3>Marxism and Class Struggle</h3>
    <p>At the heart of CPI(M)'s ideology is Marxism-Leninism, which views history as a struggle between classes. The party believes that only through the collective action of the working class and allied forces can true social and economic justice be achieved. CPI(M) advocates for the abolition of private ownership of the means of production and the establishment of a society where resources are owned and controlled by the people.</p><br>

    <h3>Secularism and Democracy</h3>
    <p>CPI(M) is a staunch defender of secularism, opposing all forms of communalism and religious fundamentalism. The party upholds the values of democracy, not just as a political system but as a way of life that ensures participation, equality, and dignity for all citizens. It fights for the protection of constitutional rights and the strengthening of democratic institutions.</p><br>

    <h3>Social Justice and Equality</h3>
    <p>The party is dedicated to eradicating caste discrimination, patriarchy, and all forms of social oppression. CPI(M) works for the upliftment of Dalits, Adivasis, women, and other marginalized groups, striving for equal opportunities and representation in all spheres of life.</p><br>

    <h3>Internationalism and Anti-Imperialism</h3>
    <p>CPI(M) stands in solidarity with socialist and progressive movements worldwide. The party opposes imperialist wars, foreign domination, and economic exploitation by global capital. It supports a multipolar world order based on peace, cooperation, and mutual respect among nations.</p><br>

    <h3>Environmental Sustainability</h3>
    <p>The party recognizes the urgent need for sustainable development. CPI(M) opposes environmentally destructive projects and advocates for policies that protect natural resources, promote renewable energy, and ensure ecological balance for future generations.</p><br>

    <h3>People's Movements and Mass Struggles</h3>
